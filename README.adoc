= clj-kafka-x

A Clojure library for the Kafka 0.10.X.X releases.

This library takes it's inspiration and some code from the [clj- kafka](https://github.com/pingles/clj-kafka/) and from the [kafkian](https://github.com/DayoOliyide/kafkian) libraries.

Current code was initially taken from [kafkian](https://github.com/DayoOliyide/kafkian), but since Apache Kafka has very ugly backward compatibilities and developing this code goes break the chain -- it was not forked normally, but splitted and refactored to dedicated library with many thanks to previous developers. Secondly (and "sad but truth") - it is too hard to rely on external maintainers for code which you're going to actively develop.

NOTE: This library is *NOT* compatible with Kafka Clusters below version 0.10. Use the [clj-kafka](https://github.com/pingles/clj-kafka/) for Kafka Clusters version 0.8 and 0.9 and [kafkian](https://github.com/DayoOliyide/kafkian) for 0.9 and, may be, 0.10.0.0. It is mainly developed for 0.10.0.1 and 0.10.1.0.

== Installation

Add the following to your [Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) `project.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
[net.tbt-post/clj-kafka-x "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
----

== Usage

=== Producer

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clj-kafka-x.producer :as kp])

(with-open [p (kp/producer {"bootstrap.servers" "localhost:9092"}
                           (kp/string-serializer)
                           (kp/string-serializer))]
  @(kp/send p (kp/record "topic-a" "Hi there!")))
----

=== Consumer

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clj-kafka-x.consumers.simple :as kc])

(with-open [c (kc/consumer {"bootstrap.servers" "localhost:9092"
                            "group.id" "consumer-id"}
                            (kc/string-deserializer)
                            (kc/string-deserializer))]
  (kc/subscribe c "topic-a")
  (kc/messages c))
----

NOTE: When you use multiple partitions per topic it is required to specify them explicitly when subscribing, i.e. `(kc/subscribe c [{:topic "topic-a" :partitions #{0 1}} {:topic "topic-b" :partitions #{0 1 2}}])`

=== Admin

WARNING: Is not working yet!

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clj-kafka-x.admin :as ka])

(def zk-util (ka/zk-utils "localhost:2181"))

(ka/create-topic zk-util "events")

(ka/create-topic zk-util "events2" :partition 3 :replication-factor 3)

(ka/create-topic zk-util "events-store" :topic-conifg {"cleanup.policy" "compact"})

(ka/topic-exists? zk-util "events")

(ka/delete-topic zk-util "events2")
