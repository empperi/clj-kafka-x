= clj-kafka-x

A Clojure library for the Kafka 0.10.X.X releases.

This library takes it's inspiration and some code from the https://github.com/pingles/clj-kafka/[clj-kafka] and from the https://github.com/DayoOliyide/kafkian[kafkian] libraries.

Current code was initially taken from https://github.com/DayoOliyide/kafkian[kafkian], but since Apache Kafka has very ugly backward compatibilities and developing this code goes break the chain -- it was not forked normally, but splitted and refactored to dedicated library with many thanks to previous developers. Secondly (and "sad but truth") - it is too hard to rely on external maintainers for code which you're going to actively develop or, at least, use in your own production.

NOTE: This library is *NOT* compatible with Kafka Clusters below version 0.10. Use the https://github.com/pingles/clj-kafka/[clj-kafka] for Kafka Clusters version 0.8 and 0.9 and https://github.com/DayoOliyide/kafkian[kafkian] for 0.9 and, may be, 0.10.0.0. It is mainly developed for 0.10.0.1 and 0.10.1.0.

== Installation

Add the following to your http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen[Leiningen's] `project.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
[net.tbt-post/clj-kafka-x "0.2.0-SNAPSHOT"]
----

== Usage

=== Producer

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clj-kafka-x.producer :as kp])

(with-open [p (kp/producer {"bootstrap.servers" "localhost:9092"}
                           (kp/string-serializer)
                           (kp/string-serializer))]
  @(kp/send p (kp/record "topic-a" "Hi there!")))
----

=== Consumer

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clj-kafka-x.consumers.simple :as kc])

(with-open [c (kc/consumer {"bootstrap.servers" "localhost:9092"
                            "group.id" "consumer-id"}
                            (kc/string-deserializer)
                            (kc/string-deserializer))]
  (kc/subscribe c "topic-a")
  (kc/messages c))
----

NOTE: When you use multiple partitions per topic it is required to specify them explicitly when subscribing, i.e. `(kc/subscribe c [{:topic "topic-a" :partitions #{0 1}} {:topic "topic-b" :partitions #{0 1 2}}])`

.Real-life (almost) example
[source,clojure]
----
(ns buzz.consumer.kafka
  (:require [clj-kafka-x.consumers.simple :as kc]
            [clojure.tools.logging :as log]))

(defn processor [msg schema] msg)
(def schema nil)
(def config {"bootstrap.servers" "localhost:9092"
             "group.id" "consumer-id"})

(defn process-message [msg]
  (let [{:keys [value topic partition offset]} msg
        processor processor ;; choose one by topic name
        schema schema]      ;; choose one by topic name
    (if (fn? processor) (processor value schema) value)))

(defn consume []
  (with-open [c (kc/consumer config
                             (kc/byte-array-deserializer)
                             (kc/byte-array-deserializer))]
    (kc/subscribe c (config/kafka-topics))
    (let [pool (kc/messages c)]
      (doseq [message pool]
        (log/warn (process-message message))))))
